# gpuWebScraper

This program was used to notify me of changes to the Newegg, Amazon, and BestBuy listings for new 
NVIDIA RTX Graphics Cards. The program scraped the site for changes in the elements that said "OUT OF STOCK."
When a change is noticed, the program was play a beep noise on the computer to notify the user.
